          The history of the most important music formats across centuries, how
          they listened, and the fight for the ultimate convenience.

        <h1>♪ Cassette Tapes (1963)</h1>
        <p>
          Invented by Phillips, cassette tapes are unique in the fact that the
          audio is not stored in grooves but through tape. This format is also
          analog and sheds the disc-shape for a much smaller-form factor: a
          plastic frame with a roll of tape containing the music. As the tape
          winds, the audio is produced in small playback systems, like that of
          record turntables. In fact, these playback systems would be so
          portable and most are able to be held from your hand.<br /><br />Unfortunately,
          the audio quality is not to the same standard as the playback of vinyl
          records. Despite both having some amount of noise impeding the music,
          the tape has more so than the records and is more intrusive. It
          wouldn’t be until the 80s that a format would be created that would
          both retain such a small form factor and be comparable to that of the
          sound quality of vinyl records.
