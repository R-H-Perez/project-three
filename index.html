          The history of the most important music formats across centuries, how
          they listened, and the fight for the ultimate convenience.

        <h1>♪ Phonograph Cylinders (1887)</h1>
        <p>
          The first music format ever made was invented by Thomas Edison, the
          creator of the light bulb. Pre-recorded music is implemented into the
          surface of a wax cylinder, as grooves. This is analog in nature (as a
          computer is not being used for playback) and these grooves are then
          tracked by a needle and played back at 120 revolutions per minute
          (RPM). At the time, this was extremely innovative and created a new
          industry. People could take music that they’ve heard without needing
          to be in the same room as the original performers.

          However, this format was not the most ideal and in fact was very
          inconvenient. These cylinders did not last very long after multiple
          plays and were susceptible to being damaged very easily, whether it
          was from scratches or the heat. Likewise, these cylinders needed to be
          played on much larger players (almost furniture-sized) with large
          motors that also needed to be maintained. The next format would
          mitigate this by strides.

      <div class="Section">
        <h1>♪ Vinyl Records (1902)</h1>
        <p>
          The most familiar and iconic of all music formats shown on this site.
          Instead of using a wax cylinder, music is replicated from flat discs
          with imprinted grooves. However, they were not made out of vinyl
          originally and were made using fragile resin called shellac. The music
          on them was also recorded at a much faster speed at 78 RPM, rather
          than 33 or 48 RPM. It wouldn’t be until 1948 when Columbia Records
          would standardize and make these discs out of a vinyl polymer at lower
          speeds.

        <p>
          The audio quality is superior and lasts much longer than the
          predating, phonograph cylinders, while also being analog. In fact,
          many consider the audio quality to be so good that they are still used
          and produced today, despite the amount of noise that bleeds through as
          the needle tracks the groove. They can also be played on much smaller
          players, record turntables, that are about the size of a large laptop
          and easier to maintain. However, the audio formats would go much
          smaller than here.

      <div class="Section">
        <h1>♪ Cassette Tapes (1963)</h1>
        <p>
          Invented by Phillips, cassette tapes are unique in the fact that the
          audio is not stored in grooves but through tape. This format is also
          analog and sheds the disc-shape for a much smaller-form factor: a
          plastic frame with a roll of tape containing the music. As the tape
          winds, the audio is produced in small playback systems, like that of
          record turntables. In fact, these playback systems would be so
          portable and most are able to be held from your hand.
        </p>

          </aside>
        </div>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the audio quality is not to the same standard as the
          playback of vinyl records. Despite both having some amount of noise
          impeding the music, the tape has more so than the records and is more
          intrusive. It wouldn’t be until the 80s that a format would be created
          that would both retain such a small form factor and be comparable to
          that of the sound quality of vinyl records.
