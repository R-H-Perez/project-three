          The history of the most important music formats across centuries, how

        <h1>♪ Phonograph Cylinders (1887)</h1>
        <p>
          The first music format ever made was invented by Thomas Edison, the
          creator of the light bulb. Pre-recorded music is implemented into the
          surface of a wax cylinder, as grooves. This is analog in nature (as a
          computer is not being used for playback) and these grooves are then
          tracked by a needle and played back at 120 revolutions per minute
          (RPM). At the time, this was extremely innovative and created a new
          industry. People could take music that they’ve heard without needing
          to be in the same room as the original performers.

          However, this format was not the most ideal and in fact was very
          inconvenient. These cylinders did not last very long after multiple
          plays and were susceptible to being damaged very easily, whether it
          was from scratches or the heat. Likewise, these cylinders needed to be
          played on much larger players (almost furniture-sized) with large
          motors that also needed to be maintained. The next format would
          mitigate this by strides.

        <h1>♪ Vinyl Records (1902)</h1>
        <p>
          The most familiar and iconic of all music formats shown on this site.
          Instead of using a wax cylinder, music is replicated from flat discs
          with imprinted grooves. However, they were not made out of vinyl
          originally and were made using fragile resin called shellac. The music
          on them was also recorded at a much faster speed at 78 RPM, rather
          than 33 or 48 RPM. It wouldn’t be until 1948 when Columbia Records
          would standardize and make these discs out of a vinyl polymer at lower
          speeds.

          The audio quality is superior and lasts much longer than the
          predating, phonograph cylinders, while also being analog. In fact,
          many consider the audio quality to be so good that they are still used
          and produced today, despite the amount of noise that bleeds through as
          the needle tracks the groove. They can also be played on much smaller
          players, record turntables, that are about the size of a large laptop
          and easier to maintain. However, the audio formats would go much
          smaller than here.

      <!-- The page about Cassette Tapes. -->
      <div class="Section">
        <h1>♪ Cassette Tapes (1963)</h1>
        <p>
          Invented by Phillips, cassette tapes are unique in the fact that the
          audio is not stored in grooves but through tape. This format is also
          analog and sheds the disc-shape for a much smaller-form factor: a
          plastic frame with a roll of tape containing the music. As the tape
          winds, the audio is produced in small playback systems, like that of
          record turntables. In fact, these playback systems would be so
          portable and most are able to be held from your hand.

          Unfortunately, the audio quality is not to the same standard as the
          playback of vinyl records. Despite both having some amount of noise
          impeding the music, the tape has more so than the records and is more
          intrusive. It wouldn’t be until the 80s that a format would be created
          that would both retain such a small form factor and be comparable to
          that of the sound quality of vinyl records.

      <!-- The page about Compact Discs. -->
      <div class="Section">
        <h1>♪ Compact Discs (CDs) (1982)</h1>
        <p>
          The most widely used out of all the formats mentioned and is about as
          favorable as vinyl records. CDs are the first digital format for music
          playback and use the same disc form-factor that are used by vinyl
          records, while also being smaller. Instead of grooves containing the
          music, compact discs use tiny miniature pits (containing binary 0’s
          and 1’s) to supplement the music information. These pits would be
          tracked by a optical-laser, from computers, to create audio samples
          and remake the pre-recorded audio. In fact, some systems that
          specialize in CD playback could be about as portable as cassette tape
          players. These discs could also be used for other uses, other than
          music playback, and could store images, disc-based games, etc.

          Like vinyl records before them, they are still being produced today
          and have extremely good audio quality. The music playback is extremely
          clear, with barely-discernible noise in the recordings. However, some
          people who enjoy vinyl more say that the music sounds too clear and
          lacks warmth. While there is definitely a different presence from the
          music, there are also many who consider CDs better than vinyl records,
          so it is up to preference.

          Due to being digital, compact discs were able to be copied onto
          computers into music files, like MP3s and FLAC. Streaming services
          would use the same masters that could be pressed onto that of compact
          discs, and would rather make the data have playback on demand. One can
          listen to music through YouTube, Spotify, and iTunes through extremely
          small devices, like your phone.

          audio in such a small-form factor. But the most important question is,
          which one of these formats are your favorite?
